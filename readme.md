# Playground

Where I dump my playground code and experiments. Below note are structured by
learning topics and only for those topics that doesn't have a dedicared sub
folder.

## Github workflows

- The current features, documents are not as nice as Gitlab.
  - In Gitlab, we can use `include` to reuse some small config.
  - In Github, we have to define a complete action, with a Dockerfile if we need
    to run the action in a container. It's annoying.

## Xcode

Open project dir from terminal

```
$ xed .
```

Apparently some Emacs style navigation and editing work in Xcode like other
input fields on Mac, however, the `opstion-a` can't work, as it input special
character instead, instead. What a shitty default setting!
